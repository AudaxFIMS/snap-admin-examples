# SnapAdmin - Test project

This is the main test project used for testing [SnapAdmin](https://github.com/AudaxFIMS/snap-admin).

This repo contains:
 * A basic Spring Boot app with entity definitions and an `import.sql` file that creates a sample database
 * End-to-end tests performed with Selenium on the SnapAdmin web interface, using the data from the sample database

The repo doesn't contain contollers, repositories, etc... because everything is generated at runtime.

Please refer to the [main README.md](../README.md) for instructions on how to run.
